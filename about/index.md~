Thank you for stopping by!
As you surely have just noticed, looking at the giant banner above, this is a blog about Computer Science, viewed not from the perspective of an expert but of a student. 
I will try to explain some concepts of informatics that I learned during my studies at University, talking about technologies and tools that I've used in my projects. 
I hope you'll enjoy! As much as I do in my learning process.
